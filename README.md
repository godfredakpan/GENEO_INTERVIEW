## Summary

### API Calls

The API calls to JSONPlaceholder are Scheduled Jobs that run Every 60 Seconds.

### Data Caching

On every successful API call, the data returned are stored in the Database and Cached to file for faster access. Ideally, I would have used Redis but choose to skip that to simplify the installation.

### Database Structure

### Initial Call

The first time an endpoint is being called, there is a 2 seconds delay to enable the Scheduled job to process the API call, cache and store to the database.
Subsequent calls to the API should be processed withing 80ms on average.
